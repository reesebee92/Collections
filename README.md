# Collections

The purpose of this project is to make use of the Java collections framework and more specifcally make use of the Tree Map Class.

Design

My program contains two steps in order to implement a contact list using the Map classes. The first step creates a program that allows me to create a contact list and sort it by last name using the Tree Map Class. The Tree Map Class allows for sorting using a comparator of my choice. I reused some code from the Java The Complete Reference Eleventh Edition textbook for sorting by last name, author Herbert Shildt. The list is sorted and saved to a file on my directory and now for step two! Step two includes prompting a user to enter the name of the file where the information is stored. Once the file is read in, another Tree Map is created and then prompts the user to make changes until theyâ€™re satisfied. The Tree Map will be displayed each time a change is made. The user has an option to add or remove a key value pair from the file.
